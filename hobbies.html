            <h3>Formula One</h3>
            <p>
              I am passionate about Formula One. This year I had to chance to go
              to a race. It was an amazing experience. My favorite team is Red
              Bull, and my favorite driver is Max Verstappen.

            <h3>Travel</h3>
            <p>
              I love traveling. Since I was little I had the chance to visit a
              lot of places around the world. I really like to discover new
              places and see all the beauty that the world has to offer. I also
              like to discover new culture and especially new food.

            <h3>Crochet</h3>
            <p>
              I love manuel activities. Last year I started crochet. I love it
              because it's an activity that doesn't require a lot of talent to
              get a pretty result, like painting. It's an activity that requires
              rigor, and there is always a new technic to learn.
